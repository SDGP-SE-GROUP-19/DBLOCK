## Bringing secure and reliable storage and transfer to the land registry system...

This is a blockchain based land deed record system that provides secure deed transfer functionality
as well as secure deed data storage in the blockchain with IPFS deed image storage.

This project is conducted by five second year undergraduates with the intention of building an anti-fraudulent,
tamper proof and highly secure application to be introduced as an improved alternative to the currently existing 
land registry system.
